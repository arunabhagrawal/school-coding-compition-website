        <p>ellDell collectively shocked everyone who follows the laptop market when it announced the XPS 13 Plus. After
            I published my first impressions last December, I got all kinds of DMs and emails from people asking what
            the heck this thing was. It’s a laptop unlike anything ever seen — and many of us have spent the past half
            year wondering whether that’s a good or bad thing.

            The regular XPS 13 (no Plus to be found) has long been one of our top Windows laptop recommendations. It’s a
            standout in many ways, build quality chief among them. Dell is continuing to sell that model and has
            upgraded it to 12th Gen processors. The XPS 13 Plus is a separate model and, as I understand, is for folks
            who want to take that XPS’s performance to the next level — anyone who wants as much raw muscle as they can
            get in a 13-inch machine.

            To that end, Dell has pulled out every shoelace to make the XPS 13 Plus as thin as it can possibly be. The
            touchpad is haptic and fully integrated into the palm rest. There are barely any ports. The keyboard has
            been flattened and the function row replaced with a row of touchable LEDs. And the Plus starts $300 more
            expensive than its non-Plus counterpart. These are all compromises, Dell’s case is, in order to achieve the
            thinnest and most powerful laptop possible.

            Unfortunately, the XPS 13 Plus is not that. It is more expensive and much hotter than laptops of its same
            size and weight that deliver similar or better power, significantly better battery life, better webcams, and
            more usable port selections — and that’s without even getting into the various finicky things with the
            keyboard deck. I can’t be the only one getting deja vu here. This whole situation is giving 2016 vibes when
            Apple made all kinds of changes to the MacBook in the name of thinness that ended up… not quite panning out.

            Like that 2016 MacBook, this XPS 13 Plus is a nice-looking computer with a great screen. But even among
            folks who really must have the Dell branding and the Windows operating system, I don’t see it as the choice.
