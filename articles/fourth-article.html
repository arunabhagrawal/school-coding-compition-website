        <p>I spent a week with the Lenovo Smart Clock Essential with Alexa on my bedside table, and I’m still unsure why
            this product exists. A digital alarm clock you can control with your voice, the $69.99 Essential is a smart
            speaker combined with a traditional LED alarm clock. But it’s not a particularly “smart” smart clock, and
            there are plenty of excellent smart alarm clocks out there, even some made by Lenovo. This is not one of
            them.

            The only use case I can see for the Essential is if you specifically want an Alexa voice assistant by your
            bed, don’t want a display with a camera in it (all Echo smart displays have cameras on board — a bit dodgy
            in a bedroom), and want a larger LED clock than what’s offered on the excellent, camera-less Echo Dot with
            Clock ($60). If you are flexible on any of these points, there are better options (which we’ll get to).

            Otherwise, this clock feels like a half-hearted attempt on Lenovo’s part to capitalize on the popularity of
            Alexa. It’s the first smart clock from Lenovo that uses Amazon’s voice assistant — its other, better models
            are all Google-based. (You won’t find any Google-powered smart speakers for sale on Amazon; go on — try).
            But it misses the mark in many ways.f basic Echo functions. For example, it doesn’t work as an intercom
            (except with other Lenovo clocks) or with Alexa calling features. You can’t set it as the default speaker
            for your room in the Alexa app, and it didn’t work in a multiroom music setup in my testing.


            The Lenovo Smart Clock 2 has the same form factor as the Essential but also works with the Lenovo Smart
            Clock dock.
            You can use Alexa Routines with the Essential. I tested one that’s triggered by dismissing an alarm. It
            worked reliably to turn on the smart lights in my room, read my calendar for the day, and start a radio
            station. But this only works once an alarm has sounded and you’ve dismissed it.

            If you want to be woken up with a specific song or station, you need to use voice to set it up first. Then
            it will appear in the choice of alarm sounds in the Alexa smartphone app, which include a wide variety of
            standard alarm tones. You can also enable a skill and have, say, The Real Housewives or Samuel L. Jackson
            wake you up.

            Sadly, the Essential doesn’t work with any of the newer “sound” triggers Echo devices have for Routines,
            where you can have the sound of running water or snoring set off a Routine. I set up an Echo Dot with Clock
            in my bathroom to listen for the sound of running water. When I turn on the shower, it starts a Routine that
            reads the weather and my calendar and then plays the radio.


            Four buttons on the top control the clock. There’s no tap-to-snooze; instead, you press the Alarm button.


            A physical mute switch is at the rear, and the clock uses a DC adaptor (there’s no battery option).
            Arguably the Essential’s biggest failing is it doesn’t have a touchscreen. Considering the almost
            identically designed and priced Lenovo Smart Clock 2 does have a touchscreen, I can’t understand why they
            opted to forgo this convenience. While its monochrome four-inch face is less distracting than a smart
            display without a touchscreen, the Essential relies on voice or the Alexa app for programming alarms. Voice
            isn’t always appropriate in the bedroom, and the Alexa app is not intuitive. There are three separate
            settings screens for the Essential clock in the app, with each one offering different options.

            The Essential also doesn’t hear as well as other Echos, and I had a lot of trouble summoning the assistant,
            often resorting to pushing the button to get its attention. The only on-device controls are for volume and
            muting the microphone, plus the button to summon Alexa and another one to snooze or show your alarm.


            There are three separate settings menus for the Essential in three unrelated sections of the Alexa app,
            making controlling it frustrating.
            The Essential is designed for those who want a simple, no-frills alarm clock, with the bonus of a smart
            assistant built-in. But, if that’s you, chances are you also probably expect your simple alarm clock to have
            a battery backup. (I’ve written before about how annoying I find it that smart alarm clocks don’t offer
            this.) In that case, this is not “essential” enough for you.


            The display shows a decibel reading below the time (standard or 24-hour format). Or you can opt for the
            current outdoor temperature and humidity.
            If you’re not picky about which voice assistant is in your bedroom and just want a good camera-free digital
            display to glance at, the Nest Hub (second gen), which is $99.99 but often on sale for considerably less, is
            a better bedside companion, adding sleep tracking and a touchscreen smart display. It’s also an excellent
            digital photo frame.

            If that’s too big for your table, the Lenovo Smart Clock 2 ($69.99) with Google is a better choice than the
            Alexa version. It’s the same size as the Essential but with a full-color touchscreen that can double as a
            digital photo frame as well as show you a live feed of your security camera if something goes bump in the
            night. It also costs the same as the Essential.

            If you are all set on Alexa, there aren’t any compelling reasons to consider the Lenovo Smart Clock
            Essential with Alexa over Amazon’s Echo devices. The Echo Show 5 with its full-color touchscreen (it does
            have a camera, though it includes a physical shutter to block it) and Echo Dot with Clock both make great
            bedside companions. And while Lenovo’s smart clocks are often on sale, most Alexa devices also regularly see
            price drops. I’ve seen Show 5s for as low as $35. The Lenovo Essential with Alexa is currently $50. At its
            full price of $70, it’s a definite no. But it might be worth considering as a smart clock for your kid if
            you can find it for $30.</p>
