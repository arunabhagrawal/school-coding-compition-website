        <p>tIt wasn’t a sure thing that the Pixel Buds Pro would turn out to be good. Google has had a mixed,
            inconsistent track record with wireless earbuds so far. The original Pixel Buds in 2017 had such an
            unconventional design that something as fundamental as putting them back into the case was overly
            complicated. The Pixel Buds 2 moved to a much sleeker, true wireless form factor, but they were beset with
            connectivity issues and frequent audio dropouts. Google righted the ship with the low-end $99 Pixel Buds
            A-Series last year, but now all eyes are on the new, flagship $199 Pixel Buds Pro — the company’s first
            earbuds with active noise cancellation — to see whether Google can really hang with the very best from
            Apple, Sony, Samsung, and others.

            Turns out, it very much can. The Pixel Buds Pro fully resolve the Bluetooth woes of the second-gen model
            while delivering improved sound quality, longer battery life, satisfactory noise cancellation, and bonus
            convenience features like multipoint. They’re not the smallest or lightest earbuds around, but Google’s
            elimination of the integrated wing tips (or “stabilizer arcs”) from prior models results in better overall
            comfort.the custom silicon and in-house audio processing that were key to developing the Pixel Buds Pro.
            Every company with earbuds that are the best at something — think noise cancellation in the case of Sony or
            transparency mode for Apple — builds its own components to achieve that. According to Google, the Pixel Buds
            Pro include a custom six-core audio chip (not to be confused with the custom Tensor chip in Pixel phones)
            that powers the active noise cancellation system, and they also use custom 11-millimeter drivers / speakers
            tuned by the company’s audio team.

            So then, let’s get right to it: noise cancellation on the Pixel Buds Pro is generally quite good for
            subduing noise at home, the office, or in a coffee shop. But I do notice that some parts of the frequency
            spectrum (like street noise from passing cars) cut through louder than they would on the AirPods Pro or
            Sony’s WF-1000XM4 buds. Since the ANC runs on Google-developed algorithms, it’s feasible that firmware
            updates could further enhance the noise-canceling strength of the Buds Pro. As it stands today, the ANC is
            more than competent — even if it won’t be bumping Sony or Bose from the top of the mountain.
